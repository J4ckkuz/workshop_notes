Workshop Notes
==============

The purpose of these notes is to aid workshop participants in learning Python through building an application for pulling cheap fuel prices from https://fuelwatch.wa.gov.au.

The first note to start from is **py01-python-libraries.md**

Here are some examples built by past workshoppers:

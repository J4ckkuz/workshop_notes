Workshop Notes
==============

The purpose of these notes is to aid workshop participants in learning Python through building an application for pulling cheap fuel prices from https://fuelwatch.wa.gov.au. You can find the development page under [RSS](https://www.fuelwatch.wa.gov.au/fuelwatch/pages/public/contentholder.jspx?key=fuelwatchRSS.html) at the bottom of the page.

The first note to start from is **py01-python-libraries.md**

Here are some examples built by past workshoppers (these sites take time to load because of free hosting):

- https://tarunsanders-fuelwatch-app.herokuapp.com
- https://fuel-slasher.herokuapp.com/table

Find the #workshop channel on http://slack.pdpd.com.au if you like to know when and where these workshops are held in Perth.
